# flotek
FloTek is a client (angular) and server (node) scaffold that I use to build interactive webapps.

Someday I'll write tests and documentation and stuff. For now, I'm just trying to get it working as a repo I can fork and extend.

## Major dependencies
* postgres 9.4
* node >= 5.0
* gulp
* hapi.js
* angularjs (1.0 for now)
* libsass
* socket.io
